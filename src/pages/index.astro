		<p class="mb-4 mr-6">
			It all began with The Last of Us and its Grounded documentary. It exposed me to games
			development, as both a collaborative effort and something I want participate in. Since then, I
			have taken any opportunities I could to collaborate on games and software.
			<p class="mb-4 mr-6">
				From game jams during my bachelors in Computer Science, to group projects from my
				programming bootcamp. Collaborating on projects has been a dream, and I fortunate enough to
				continue this journey in my MSc Computer Games Programming.
