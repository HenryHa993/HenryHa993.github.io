## About
This procedural animation library was done for final year dissertation at Warwick University. The goal was to create a library which abstracted and refined the process of coding new procedural animations within Unity.

Procedural animations rely on programmed calculations each frame to create reactive and natural movements. This was combines with a basic behaviour tree implementation and A* pathfinding algorithm to display such animations.

## Techniques
This was a great learning experience, which allowed me to develop my knowledge of game
development and tool creation.

Here are some of the tools and techniques I used:

**Artificial Intelligence**
1. Behaviour Trees
2. A* Pathfinding Algorithm

**Languages and Tools**
1. C#
    - Delegates
2. Behaviour Bricks
3. Unity
4. GitHub
