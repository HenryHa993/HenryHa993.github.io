## About
This was a submission for the **2023 Warwick Game Jame** in collaboration with [Joel Evans](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joel-evans-dev/).

This game was inspired by the ruleset behind **Snakes and Foxes** which is a board game from the **Wheel of Time**.

We learned a huge amount participating and showcasing this project, and are overall proud of the submission. Below are some takeaways we had:
1. **Include playtesting early**

    A limitation of our project was that we did not do enough external playtesting. Overall, rulesets were not as clear as they could have been and we noticed this during the showcase.

2. **More time dedicated to finalise design**

    It can be often hard to keep on the same page and vision for a game, and at points we had to go back to design to re-align ideas.

Overall, this was a fun project and a great opportunity to collaborate on a shared vision.
