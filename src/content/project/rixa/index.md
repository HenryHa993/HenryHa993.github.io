## About
Rixa is a retro, top-down shooter inspired by Commando on the C64. This was originally a group project done under the Developer Academy but I recently decided to overhaul it as I recently got some amazing C++ [**feedback**](/posts/sfas-reto/) and thought it was a good chance to reinforce some learning.

This was made using **C++** and Sumo Digital's **Playbuffer** library.

**Note**: This project codebase is still WIP, as some improvements based on the feedback are still on the way.

## Refactoring
The original codebase was admittedly very messy, and a major reason why this project was not previously included in my portfolio. This was due to a number of reasons, but the main ones were time constraints and being part of quite a large team at the time. Here were some of the key improvements I wanted to make to the codebase:

1. Separate functionality into more classes.
    - The `Main.cpp` originally had over 1000 lines of code and needed some severe refactoring.
    - See [**Overhauling commit**](https://github.com/d7kh3ty/rixa/commit/879c57091c36d4994a33f6861b57da2eb35cfc4e)
2. De-allocating of dynamically allocated memory
    - De-allocating memory when projectiles and enemies were destroyed. Or when specific game states occured.
3. Swapping out enum types for the enum class
    - For reasons mentioned in this article [^1].

The following is to-do:

4. Class based game states.
5. HUD
6. Action-based input system.
7. Filling in missing assertions.
