## About
Escape Ghoul Prison is a puzzle observation game made using only **C++** and **DirectX**. In this project, I implement my very own **behaviour tree system** using modern C++ techniques such as **coroutines**.

This is a submission to **Grads In Game's Search For a Star 2024** competition, in which I became a [**finalist**](https://gradsingames.com/search-for-a-star/sfas-2024-the-finalists/#prog) for!

This project was scored and rated by a range of [industry professionals](https://gradsingames.com/search-for-a-star/sfas-2024-the-finalists/#prog) and was an incredibly fun technical challenge. I received some awesome feedback for this project, so I wrote a separate learnings post [**here**](/posts/sfas-retro/).

I have also made improvements to the behaviour tree, which you can find [**here**](/projects/behaviour-tree/)!

## Techniques
Coming into this competition, I really wanted to work on some sort of AI behaviour. Having previously worked with **behaviour trees** in **UE5** and **Unity**, I decided to make my very own from scratch!

### C++
1. **Coroutines**
    - Having previous experience with coroutines in **C#** and **Unity** made me comfortable enough to pick up and utilise it in this project for the **behaviour tree** implementation.
    - In specific, coroutines were used to implement the `RUNNING` return state, which means that a specific node hasn't finished operating within that tick and must continue to run in the next update cycle.
    - This is a modern **C++ 20** technique.
    
        See [`Source/Engine/Implementation/BehaviourTree`](https://github.com/HenryHa993/EscapeGhoulPrison/tree/main/Source/Engine/Implementation/BehaviourTree)

2. **Behaviour Tree**
    - Features of the behaviour tree included: **Selector Nodes**, **Sequence Nodes**, **Services** and **RUNNING State functionality**.
    - This implementation is used for the AI of the prison warden in the game.
    
        See [`Source/Engine/Implementation/BehaviourTree`](https://github.com/HenryHa993/EscapeGhoulPrison/tree/main/Source/Engine/Implementation/BehaviourTree)

3. **Sprite System**
    - Built out a sprite script in order to manage multiple different billboards under a single object.
    - This was used for the stage indicators on the left, as well as the prison warden's sprite changes and detection indicator.
    
        See [`Source/Engine/Implementation/GameObjects`](https://github.com/HenryHa993/EscapeGhoulPrison/tree/main/Source/Engine/Implementation/GameObjects)

### Artificial Intelligence
1. **WardenBT**
    - Based off my behaviour tree, I built out a few **task nodes** and **services** to construct the patrolling behaviour of the prison warden.
    
        See [`Source/Game/EnemyBTs`](https://github.com/HenryHa993/EscapeGhoulPrison/tree/main/Source/Game/EnemyBTs)

### Version Control
1. **GitHub**
