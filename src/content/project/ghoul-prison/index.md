## About
Escape Ghoul Prison is a puzzle observation game made using only **C++** and **DirectX**. In this project, I implement my very own **behaviour tree system** using modern C++ techniques such as **coroutines**.

This is a submission to **Grads In Game's Search For a Star 2024** competition, in which I became a [**finalist**](https://gradsingames.com/search-for-a-star/sfas-2024-the-finalists/#prog) for!

This project was scored and rated by a vast range of [**industry professionals**](https://gradsingames.com/search-for-a-star/sfas-2024-the-finalists/#prog) and was an incredibly fun technical challenge. I received some awesome feedback for this project, so I will likely write a separate retrospective post in the near future.

## Techniques
Coming into this competition, I really wanted to work on some sort of AI behaviour. Having previously worked with **behaviour trees** in **UE5** and **Unity**, I decided to make my very own from scratch!

**Artificial Intelligence**
1. Behaviour Trees
2. Coroutines to develop `RUNNING` return states for nodes

**Languages and Tools**
1. C++
    - Coroutines
2. DirectX
3. GitHub
