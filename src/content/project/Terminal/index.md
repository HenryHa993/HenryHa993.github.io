## About
Terminal is a horror shooter made using **C++** and **UE5**. This project contains 4 unique enemies, which undergo different animations and AI.

This is a personal remake of a group project made during my time under [The Developer Academy's](https://thedeveloperacademy.com/) Unreal Engine 5 training.

This project was initially a zombie shooter with bare-bones AI and animation implementation. Upon revisit, I wanted to improve on those fronts and develop behaviours which take advantage of layered animations and Unreal Engine's EQS systems. Most of these components are done using C++ and are documented below in the **Related Posts** section.
